		<h4>This Website</h4>
		<p> The design of this website involved consideration of design principles and the implementation involved my first experience using Foundation, an HTML/CSS framework. </p>
		<p>The prototype for the site includes more features that address requirements for the final project, which involved utilizing process and creation design principles.</p>

		<h5>Process</h5>
		<p>The problem I faced with this project was designing a clean, professional, and responsive web page that showcases my featured projects and successfully highlights my past accomplishments. In developing a solution, I drew up the following objectives:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Focus on presentation & visuals</li>
			<li>Design must emphasize ease of navigation</li>
			<li>Maintain the user’s interest and attention on content/projects</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I incorporated design elements that I used in past projects from other design classes to form a general idea of what I wanted the layout to look like. I made a few rough sketches, but the main pre-visualization work came from what I developed using <a class="link" href="./files/portfolio_wireframe/home.html">Axure.</a></p>
		 <p><div class="clearing assembled">
			<ul class="clearing-thumbs" data-clearing>

			<li><a class="th thumbnail" href="./img/thissite2.JPG"><img src="./img/thissite2.JPG" alt="one" /></a></li>
			</ul>
			</div></p>
		<p>For the design of this project I explored a combination of different design principles. For instance, I wanted to make sure that I was paying attention to <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The placement of elements, forming rows or columns with edges, to form a sense of cohesion">alignment</span> at all times. I focused on the relationships between elements and how they related to each other on the space of the page. I wanted to demonstrate this principle on every page, though I found myself focusing primarily on alignment when designing the home page. I also utilized the principle of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Similar elements are perceived to be related to each other, creating a grouping effect">similarity</span> to create uniformity in elements that I wanted the user to implicitly group together (such as the ‘cards’ for each on project on the ‘Project’ parent page). This resulted in a simple and somewhat repetitive visual design, but I chose to take that design direction to generate consistency and hopefully improve the ease of navigation for users.</p>
		<p><span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The consideration of spatial and environmental information when navigating to a destination">Wayfinding</span> was another principle I wanted to incorporate into this design. It is especially pertinent to the site’s purpose to hold the user’s attention for long enough to read about me or view my projects before they navigate away from the site, so I wanted the design to facilitate a certain navigation flow. I organized the links on the nav bar from left to right in a specific sequence, and certain content links to other pages that lead up to the contact section, as outlined below.</p>
		<p><img class="panel" src="img/thissitediagram.JPG" alt="one" /></p>
		<p>Later on in the design process (after drawing up the wireframe), I wanted to introduce another principle--<span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The organization of information into grouped sections to manage complexity and reinforce informational relationships">Layering</span>--to manage the amount of content on each page and the sheer number of pages needed to grant each of my projects their own dedicated areas. I solved this problem by using tabs in each Project section of the site, and using project "cards" that link to a project's page. I realized that this also made navigation between projects much easier.</p>
		<p>Another part of this design that I feel is particularly effective is my implementation of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Similar parts are expressed in similar ways, thus improving learnability and usability">Consistency</span>.I wanted to adhere to a consistent aesthetic with the site, so I chose to stick with using a few different shades of light blue to maintain a simple visual design. The use of this principle improves learnability of the site's layout and thus improves the process of navigating through areas of the site. The goal of keeping the colors at a minimum was to make sure that I could establish a solid foundation for each page’s skeletal structure before deciding on visuals. I also wanted to emphasize the feeling of simplicity to facilitate ease of usability, in keeping with the <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The principle that aesthetically-appealing designs are perceived as easier to use than less appealing designs">Aesthetic-usability effect</span>. There is a trade-off here in some respects: As a result of focusing on showcasing projects and content, it is not the most visually sophisticated design. Instead, I chose to focus on simplicity, similarity, and consistency in favor of a (hopefully) streamlined and straightforward browsing experience for the user. </p>

		<h4>DePaul Online</h4>
		<p> This project was an application design that targeted the needs of the DePaul CDM (College of Computing and Digital Media) student userbase. In the course, we were tasked with addressing the demand for a new centralized system for CDM students to use. One of the goals of the design was to develop a solution that would serve as a central hub for student resources --- resources which were currently spread out across three to four academic portal sites. </p>

		<h4 id="title">North Lawndale Greening Committee</h4>
		<p> This project involved experimentation with WordPress plugins and using advanced features of WordPress. It was one of my first experiences with the process of shipping a product to a client.</p>
		<p>The final product is a stylized WordPress site, using multiple plugins to provide the functionality outlined by the client's user criteria. The other half of the project was transferring ownership of the product to the client, complete with documentation outlining how to manage the backend and configure the content of the site.</p>

		<h5>Process</h5>
		<p>For this project, I worked with a small team of developers and designers to put together a website for the North Lawndale Greening Committee, a non-profit community organization in North Lawndale, Chicago. We were challenged with creating a new site that fulfilled the client's needs and provided the functionality that the client's current site could not address. We had the objective of creating an aesthetically-pleasing design and creating a fresh, responsive web page for their content. We were also tasked with making it easier for the site admin to curate content, track user analytics, and make it easier for users to donate and volunteer for events.</p>
		<p>Our process involved sitting down with stakeholders and establishing design requirements before leaping straight into implementing a solution. We drew up documentation with intended features, constraints, and a list of design challenges. The client explicitly desired a solution using WordPress, and we wanted to make managing the backend of the site to be as easy for the client as possible.</p>
		<p>Our team worked with the client to decide on themes, appearances, requirements, and site features. We implemented the Kirigami theme with custom CSS and modified plugins such as an Ajax Calendar, Google Maps, and Custom Post Types. We used Custom Post Types to make it simple for the admin to add new sections to pages, such as new featured gardens, organization members, and news posts. </p>
		
		<section><img class="panel" src="./img/nlgc1.JPG" alt="one" /></section>
		
		<p>In designing the look and feel of the site, I had several principles in mind. The client was looking for a visually pleasing site that conveyed the beauty and serenity of their gardens. This site was going to be focused on featuring visual content, so I decided to utilize the <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The phenomenon that images leave more lasting impressions than text">Picture Superiority Effect</span> for a visual browsing experience. Images of the most visually impressive gardens can be featured on the large image slideshow on the homepage, and it was clear that we had to feature images of several different gardens throughout the site to satisfy the client's requirement for an immersive browsing experience. We also implemented the principle of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The clarity of text on the page, as a result of spacing, font-style, and size">Legibility</span>, both to create an appealing visual design in combination with the use of imagery and also to keep the text readable for senior members of the community that may have poor eye sight. </p>
		
		<p>While we wanted to place an emphasis on images in the site's design, we also wanted to maximize the <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The ratio of relevant to irrelevant content on a page. The higher, the better.">Signal-to-Noise ratio</span> as much as possible in functionality relating to the donation pages and the contact pages. Implementing this principle ensures that the site's features are not buried under an overabundance of images or ostentatious design choices.</p>
		
		<p>The organization of the nav bar was laid out with a <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="A structure for organizing and undestanding information complexity.">Hierarchy</span> of information in mind, similar to a Stair-style of hierarchical relationships. It traces a theoretical path of a user's movement from one page to another on the site, increasingly advancing as more knowledge is gained and interest is potentially generated. For instance, the average case might see the user navigating from the high-level pages (Home to the About section), then to Gardens and potentially News/Events, and finally to the Contact or Donate pages if the user's interest is peaked. </p>
		
		<section><img class="panel" src="./img/nlgc2.JPG" alt="one" /></section>
		
		<p>The great part about using WordPress for our solution is that it leaves the client admin with a great amount of depth of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The level of control provided by a system should be related to the proficiecy of the user.">Control</span>. The base level functionality for curating the site's content is very easy to learn for newer users, but once the client becomes more comfortable with the system, there are many features that can be taken advantage of to increase the capabilities of the site and its features, such as downloading more plugins, extending the functionality of custom post types, and customizing the Kirigami theme even further.</p>

		<h4>Gamestore</h4>
		<p> This project was a web application created using Ruby on Rails. Before I created the application, I started pre-visualizing the project on paper and built a mock-up using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used JQuery UI for several elements, such as the image tabs and lists. I also experimented with CSS grid systems (In this case I tried out 960.css.)</p>

		<h4>Submit a Question</h4>
		<p> This project started as a feature for this site and a concept I explored using Axure. It's purpose was to allow users to ask me a question directly through the site by filling out a simple form and submitting it.</p>
		<p><h5>Images</h5></p>	
		   <div class="clearing assembled">
			<ul class="clearing-thumbs" data-clearing>
			<li><a class="th thumbnail" href="./img/question2.JPG"><img src="./img/question2.JPG" alt="one" /></a></li>
			<li><a class="th thumbnail" href="./img/question3.JPG"><img src="./img/question3.JPG" alt="one" /></a></li>
			</ul>

		<hr />
		<h5>Process</h5>
		<p>The design behind this concept revolved around process-oriented design principles. It was meant to get me thinking about creating efficient, user-centered designs. The challenge of this project was to create a streamlined process that was easy to use and accommodating of the user's needs, errors, and decisions. My objectives for this project were to: maintain the visibility of the user's location within the process, create a flexible solution, and provide the user with feedback when appropriate.</p>
		<section><img class="panel" src="./img/question4.JPG" alt="one" /></section>
		<p>I implemented the design for this solution in <a class="link" href="./files/portfolio_wireframe/specific_question.html">Axure</a>. I used a dynamic panel with four states for the content body, and variables to load and store the user input name, email address, and question through each step of the process.</p>
		
		<p>In keeping with the flexibility goal, I made sure that the user can navigate through the process in a variety of ways. The user can click on any of the numbered circles to go back or step through the process. I also implemented this feature to improve <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Increasing usability by clearly communicating the system's status and/or methods of use">Visibility</span>. It is crucial to me that the user knows where they are in the process at any given time, even if the process itself is very straightforward. I also used the principle of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="The maintenance of information complexity in which only certain information is displayed at a given time">Progressive Disclosure</span> to help simplify the process, guiding the user to mentally step through their thought processes in a specific way. My approach in using this principle is breaking this task into related segments to make providing information even easier. To illustrate the user's progress through the steps, I used <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="A technique for indication or calling the user's attention to a particular area or page element">Highlighting</span> to strengthen the visibility of the current step. I created a progress-bar indicator by highlighting the numbers of the steps at each point leading up to the user's current place in the process.</p>
		
		<section><img class="panel" src="./img/question5.JPG" alt="one" /></section>
		
		<p>One way I would make this prototype even better is including validators for the input text areas. For the time being, I utilized the principle of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Prevention of unintended actions by requiring verification">Confirmation</span> for the user to double check the information they have provided at the last step before submitting the form. I used this principle as a technique to prevent user error, but I feel that I can iterate on this design further by strengthening error prevention and using some form of validation. </p>
