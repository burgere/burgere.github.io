	<p class="text-justify">I’ve been working with computers for most of my life. It’s become a passion of mine to work with technology and explore how systems work. I think that the design and UI/UX side of my interests stems from my computer gaming hobby. I always find myself critiquing and picking apart visual systems in my favorite video games and web applications, and I became very interested with how designs for GUI originate, how they are built, and how they function.</p>
	
	<p class="text-justify">I also developed a new appreciation for software application developers, and how they maintained my favorite products with new features and updates. Reading patch notes for games was an exciting thing for me. The idea of creating applications like that, sharing them, and then interacting with a community and continuing to iterate on that product is what excites me about becoming a developer. </p>

	<p>I’ve been a DePaul student for three years as an Interactive Media major. I’ve also taken a Computer Science minor, which has worked very well with the user-centered design and user experience studies in my major.</p> 
	
	<p>The courses I enjoyed most were the ones that had me working with technology hands on. It all started with my first HTML/CSS/Javascript class in freshman year. The joy I had from building web pages for class was unlike any kind of fun I had doing anything for any class --- in high school, middle school, anywhere or any-when. And it only got more fun from there.</p> 

	<p>What you’ll see on this site are <a class="link" href="./projects.html">projects</a> I’ve produced for those classes. These are the ones I took away some great value from, and they represent landmarks in my education. I plan to continue supporting them and learning from them as I continue my career. I want to show a progression with these projects, starting from the fundamentals of a programming language to more advanced projects. Each project has a section associated with it, and each project has a narrative. My desire is to outline my thought process for each, and describe how I developed their solutions. </p>
