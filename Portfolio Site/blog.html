		<h3>Conclusions on Design & Design Principles</h3>

		I have learned a LOT of stuff in the past three years at DePaul. A lot of development, and a lot of design. And chances are, I'm going to keep on learning even more. I take a look back at what I knew three years ago in comparison to what I know now, and I would never have imagined then what I have learned today. 
		</p>
		<p>This site and the other projects I've chosen to feature here are among the best examples of my applied knowledge. The three projects that I've initially fleshed out content-wise (<a class="link" href="./design.html#panel3design">The North Lawndale site</a>, <a class="link" href="./design.html#panel1design">this site</a>, and the <a class="link" href="./design.html#panel4design">Question feature</a> in Axure) were developed right around the same time, and they share a few of the same design concepts. I can talk about all the projects I've done in the past, but right now those three are the ones that I am most proud of. They represent new and challenging experiences that comprise of my first foray into the field of interaction design. The experience of producing these projects have shown me how to incorporate intelligent design decisions as early as possible in the development process. I have learned how essential it can be to plan designs on paper, and firmly establish which design principles or patterns to follow, before jumping into the implementation phase of a project.</p>
		<p>The application of design principles makes all the difference between a well-thought out design and an aimless one. It demonstrates intent and planning---the presence of a thought process behind a product, and an acknowledgement of the user's needs. I'm glad to have worked with them, and as I embark on future projects, I will continue to be mindful of them.</p>

		<h3>Using Foundation</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>During the process of designing this website, I was introduced to the HTML/CSS/Javascript framework called Foundation from an instructor. Upon exploring the documentation for the framework, I became inspired to modify my design based on the new tools that Foundation had to offer. I found myself able to create flexible content areas such as tabs and integrate responsive design principles with ease. I was able to create and customize image slideshows without coding something in Javascript from scratch. In fact, I was able to create more functionality for the site without using Javascript than I thought I could in the first place.</p>
		<p>I feel like using Foundation has inspired me to explore the world of web development even further. From a design perspective, Foundation as a tool is very fulfilling. I definitely see myself using it for future design projects, and if you aren't familiar with what Foundation is, take a look at it <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#008cba">here.</a></p>
		<p>No seriously. I'm really liking it right now. I don't work for them or anything. This is not a commercial.</p>
